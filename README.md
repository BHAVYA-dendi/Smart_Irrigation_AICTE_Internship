# Smart Irrigation – AICTE Internship Project

This project is part of the AICTE Virtual Internship program on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Description

The Smart Irrigation system uses a machine learning model to assist in automating irrigation decisions based on environmental data like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

## Files Included

- `Smart_Irrigation.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with the implementation
- `irrigation_machine.csv` – Dataset used for training the model
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Upload the `irrigation_machine.csv` file when prompted.
3. Run all cells to train the model and view predictions.

## Purpose

To apply basic machine learning techniques to real-world problems as part of the AICTE internship learning experience.
